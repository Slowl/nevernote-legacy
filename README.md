A note project because my OnePlus One is 6yo now and I have alot of notes stocked on it so I'm afraid to lose my phone and all the important notes.

Also because I'm depressed and coding is the only thing that helps me to feel better.
I can write anything I want here because no one will ever read this, companies spend more time reading the resume of kids coming out of paid schools than the real code of a passionate guy who's been fighting for three years to prove himself, so yes.

want to learn web localStorage and firebase database with this shitty project
